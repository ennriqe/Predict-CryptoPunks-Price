# Predicting Crypto Punk Prices

In this project we have developed a model that predicts the prices of CryptoPunks, we do so by using 16k historical sales of these NFTs over the last 3 years by using as features their attributes, a time feature, the price of Etheurm, the floor price of the NFTs and features we extracted from their pixels. We end up with an accurate model that can predict the ETH prices of CryptoPunks with a **mean accuracy of 89%** as measured by 1-MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). 

This model has been trained so that it can generalize and produce a fair value for a given Punk in the future, it can potentially be used by people or smart contracts that want to assess how much a Punk is worth at a given time, based on this they could either, make a bid, accept one or set this price as an estimate of the TVL to issue a loan.

Given that the average price of these NFTs has been $100k over the last 3 years, market participants that might make use of these predictions will want to make sure that they are produced by the same unique model that has given the predictions for the other market participants, to ensure this, we use the **Giza ML** platform which allows us to train our model and produce **Zero-Knowledge proofs** that verify that a given prediction was generated by the model we offer.

# Forming the Dataset

To create the comprehensive dataset required for this project, follow the steps outlined below, utilizing various data sources ranging from Dune Analytics to external APIs.

## Crypto Punk Trades

To gather data on all Crypto Punk trades, utilize the following Dune Analytics query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM cryptopunks.trades
```

## Dune Query: [Cryptopunks Trades](https://dune.com/queries/3469248)

To download the data:
1. Access the link provided.
2. With Dune Plus, you can download the query results to a CSV file.

## Floor Price Data: [Floor Price Data](https://dune.com/queries/3455015)

The floor price data is sourced through a Dune Analytics query, structured as follows:

```sql
-- Dune Query for Floor Price Data

  cryptopunk_sales AS (

# Others
To query the images of the punks that we use to extract the skin color of the punks we use and run label_skin.py and get the data from https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingnft/cryptopunks

To query the floor price today we use the OpenSea API using get_punk_floor_today().

To query the ETH price we query the CoinGecko API using get_ethereum_price_history().

To generate the whole dataset we use generate_dataset.py
