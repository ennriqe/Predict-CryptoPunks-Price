**Predicting Crypto Punk Prices**

In this project we have developed a model that predicts the prices of CryptoPunks, we do so by using 16k historical sales of these NFTs over the last 3 years by using as features their attributes, a time feature, the price of Etheurm, the floor price of the NFTs and features we extracted from their pixels. We end up with an accurate model that can predict the ETH prices of CryptoPunks with a **mean accuracy of 89%** as measured by 1-MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). 

This model has been trained so that it can generalize and produce a fair value for a given Punk in the future, it can potentially be used by people or smart contracts that want to assess how much a Punk is worth at a given time, based on this they could either, make a bid, accept one or set this price as an estimate of the TVL to issue a loan.

Given that the average price of these NFTs has been $100k over the last 3 years, market participants that might make use of these predictions will want to make sure that they are produced by the same unique model that has given the predictions for the other market participants, to ensure this, we use the **Giza ML** platform which allows us to train our model and produce **Zero-Knowledge proofs** that verify that a given prediction was generated by the model we offer.

Instructions on how to replicate the dataset are found in the text file Creating the Dataset in this same repository.
